# Clean Code Friday

Welcome to the Clean Code Friday repository! This project is dedicated to writing and organizing clean, efficient code in various programming languages, including **Node.js**, **Solidity**, **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**.

This repository is structured to help developers follow best practices, improve code readability, and write maintainable software.

## Repository Structure

- **nodejs/**: Contains Node.js projects, tutorials, and best practices for writing clean code in JavaScript runtime.
- **solidity/**: This folder contains smart contracts and tests for Solidity, focusing on clean and secure smart contract development.
- **typescript/**: Here you'll find TypeScript projects and utilities to demonstrate clean, strongly-typed JavaScript.
- **javascript/**: General JavaScript code examples focusing on clean code principles, both for the browser and Node.js.
- **python/**: Python projects and utilities that follow best practices for clean, maintainable code.

## Getting Started

To get started, navigate to the specific language folder you're interested in. Each folder contains its own `README.md` with further instructions on how to get started, along with resources and best practices.

## Topics Covered

Throughout the projects and examples, the following clean code principles will be applied:
- Proper naming conventions
- Modular, reusable code
- Error handling
- Asynchronous programming best practices
- Function and variable naming conventions
- Testing (unit and integration)

Stay tuned for regular updates and new content every Friday!

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request. Make sure to follow the best practices and coding guidelines presented in each folder.
